# Project nami

To save our planet, we try to make an idea for saving ocean health.

# About us

Our purpose is to detect ocean pollution. It is key to know whether the current recycling system is appropriately working. If a relatively large amount of plastic is found in a particular area on an ongoing basis, the recycling system in that area may be reviewed. This is the first step toward decreasing ocean plastics and maintaining ocean health.

# Mission

Make an application that detects, visualizes, tracks and forecasts ocean plastic amounts. There are methods to detect objects on the ground however, it is very challenging to detect the ocean one.

The platform is provided free to all supporters.  Information include density , regions, and data range of ocean debris .

A ocean debris tracking data can help us determine if modern recycling systems are optimal.
If we consistently see large amounts of plastics in a particular area, we need to re-evaluate the recycling system in that area.

**Why detecting is important** 

No one have the way to know where ocean debris came from. Our project gives proof that question. If a large amount of plastic is found in a particular area on an ongoing basis, we should review the recycling system in that area.

As a future use-case, our solution can be deployed on systems which auto-cleans the debris from the oceans.

# Mission

We are looking for our first clients who feel our vision and will grow this project with us!

And we are committed to solving your problems through this project.
